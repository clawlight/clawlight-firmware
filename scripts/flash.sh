# flash.sh — build the clawlight firmware for the Seeed XIAO ESP32-C6 and flash
# whichever board is currently plugged in, in one command.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/flash.sh                      Build the XIAO firmware and flash the
#                                         connected board.
#   scripts/flash.sh --monitor            ...then open a serial monitor.
#   scripts/flash.sh --port /dev/cu.usbmodem101
#                                         Flash a specific serial device.
#   scripts/flash.sh --elf path/to/fw.elf Flash a prebuilt ELF (skip the build).
#   scripts/flash.sh --firmware-dir DIR   Build a clawlight-firmware checkout at
#                                         a different path (default: this repo —
#                                         the one this script lives in — or
#                                         $CLAWLIGHT_FIRMWARE_DIR).
#   scripts/flash.sh --connect-timeout N  Seconds to wait at "Connecting…" before
#                                         prompting for download mode (default 15).
#
# If clawlight is driving the LEDs it holds the serial port open, and a serial
# port is exclusive — so this pauses the LEDs (flips `led_enabled` off so the
# menu bar daemon lets go), flashes, then restores the setting, exactly like
# `clawlight update` does.
#
# If the board isn't in download mode, espflash just sits at "Connecting…". This
# caps that wait (--connect-timeout / $FLASH_CONNECT_TIMEOUT), then prints how to
# enter the bootloader by hand and waits for you to press Enter to retry — so a
# first flash usually goes: run it, do the BOOT/RESET dance, Enter.
#
# Requires: espflash (`cargo install espflash`) and, unless --elf is given, the
# firmware sources in this repo (its Cargo.toml, partitions.csv, .cargo/config.toml).

flash.sh: espflash couldn't sync with the board.

It stalled at "Connecting…" (or you saw `espflash::timeout`) — the XIAO didn't
enter download mode on its own. Put it there by hand:

  1. Press and HOLD the BOOT button (labeled B, next to the USB-C port).
  2. While holding BOOT, tap the RESET button (labeled R) once.
     (No luck? Unplug and replug the USB-C cable while still holding BOOT.)
  3. RELEASE BOOT.

The board stays in download mode until its next reset, so there's no rush.
espflash resets it back into the app after a successful flash.

Still timing out? Use a DATA USB-C cable (not charge-only), and leave only the
one board plugged in (or pass --port).
